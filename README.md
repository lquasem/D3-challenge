# D3-challenge
Data Driven Documents
The task:
1)To create a scatter plot between two of the data variables, the chart below above shows the correlation between poverty and healthcare.
Using the D3 techniques, created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

2)
While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Tooltips were added to circles and displayed each tooltip with the data... using the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmer.
